Valencia sunk by the Yellow Submarine

On a day when a win was imperative for Valencia, after Barcelona s earlier victory at Real Madrid, Los Che just didnt have enough in the tank to get past a dogged Villarreal side.

Their cause wasnt helped by Simone Zaza s sending off on the hour, and Marcelino will now be without his striker for the first game of the new year.

Three defeats in the last four has knocked Valencia completely out of their stride.

Now 11 points behind Barcelona, it wasnt that long ago that the gap could ve been as little as two points.

Four yellow cards in the first half spoke of the intense battle that this game was always going to be, and in the midst of it all, Carlos Bacca put the visitors ahead on 24.

It proved to be the only goal of a frenetic match, Gabriel Paulista hitting the bar for the hosts in the second half.

That would be the closest Marcelino s side would come to clawing back at least a point.

Eight more yellows and two subsequent reds - for Zaza and Manu Trigueros - authored the second half; low on quality but a little too high on desire.

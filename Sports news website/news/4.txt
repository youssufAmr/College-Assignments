Without making a lot of noise and without playing spectacular football, although it is effective, Juventus continue racking up wins, this time against Roma.

The victory, in the main game of the 18th week of Serie A, meant the bianconeri end 2017 in second place, just a point behind leaders Napoli.

Benatia s early goal was decisive, as were the contributions of Pjanic, Cuadrado and Mandzukic in helping Higuain up front.

For the third consecutive game, Paulo Dybala sat on the bench.

The match started with a lot of intensity and Pjanic magnificently orchestrated things.

After a corner kick, Benatia, Roma s ex-defender, took advantage of the ball coming back off of the woodwork to put Juve into the lead.

However, the visitors didnt give up and created several dangerous chances.

Florenzi hitting the crossbar was the closest they would come against a Juventus side that has now won five in a row, and have kept a clean sheet in their last eight games in all competitions.

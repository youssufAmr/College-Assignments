Everton boss Sam Allardyce continued his unbeaten start to the job with a dogged and defensively strong goalless draw against champions Chelsea.

With Morata absent, Conte again opted for Hazard to lead the line rather than place his trust in out-and-out striker Michy Batshuayi.

Hazard occupied the role in last week s win over Southampton, with Morata recovering from a back injury, but his natural tendency is to drop deep and that meant much of Chelsea s play was in front of Everton s backline.

The visitors created space in wide positions through wing-backs Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses, but found Everton s well-drilled defence equal to that route of attack.

Without a focal point in the penalty box the visitors lacked a clinical edge, and their best chances came when Pedro broke free on the counter attack to force Pickford into a save, and Hazard found space to shoot from the edge of the box.

Conte did call for Batshuayi, whose last goals came for the club s under-21s in a Checkatrade Trophy win over MK Dons, with 20 minutes to go but the Belgium forward was denied any real opportunities.

And Chelsea nearly paid the price for their inability to capitalise on their dominance, with Keane heading Everton s best chance of the game over the crossbar in injury time.

Everton kept their first Premier League clean sheet in nine games against Chelsea, since a 1-0 win in September 2013.

Chelsea boss Antonio Conte on Sky Sports: "We had 26 shots, only eight on target. I think we dominated the game and lots of chances to score. I think it is an unfair result. Everton deserve credit but we deserve to win.

"Maybe Jordan Pickford was the best player for them. We dominated the game and it is a pity to drop two points. It is normal to drop points with a poor performance but not today.

"It is not simple to dominate here, we needed a bit of luck.
